# TypeScript Type Challenges

![TypeScript Type Challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/raw/main/screenshots/logo.svg)

Welcome to the **TypeScript Type Challenges** repository! 🚀

## 📚 What Are Type Challenges?

Type challenges are exercises that focus on TypeScript's type system. Each challenge is crafted to deepen your understanding of TypeScript's type system and improve your ability to write robust, type-safe code.

## 🧠 Challenge Structure

Each challenge follows a consistent structure:

- **Example**: Provides input and output examples.
- **Type Definition**: The type you need to implement.
- **Test Cases**: A set of test cases to validate your solution.

Example:

```typescript
type MyPick<T, K extends keyof T> = {
  [P in K]: T[P];
};
```

## 🧩 Challenge Categories

The challenges are grouped into several categories:

- **Basic Types**: Understanding primitive types, arrays, and tuples.
- **Object Types**: Working with objects, interfaces, and type aliases.
- **Utility Types**: Implementing and using built-in utility types like `Pick`, `Readonly`, and `Exclude`.
- **Advanced Types**: Exploring advanced concepts like conditional types, mapped types, and recursion.
